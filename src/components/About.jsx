        <p className="description">Iâ€™m Jordan Bank, a software developer from New York City. I currently teach software engineering at General Assembly in the Flatiron District of Manhattan. I'm also a graphic designer and photographer.</p>
        <p className="description">I'm passionate about using my skillset to educate and solve complex problems.</p>
        <p className="description">In my spare time I like cooking, playing video games, reading, and activities such as hiking, ice skating, and tennis. I also believe in the value of just taking a day to do absolutely nothing every once in a while. I'm a fan of the New York Knicks, New York Giants, and New York Mets and I have spent a lot of my life watching those teams lose.</p>
